## Description: <br>
Keyless live web search via Keenable, using a bundled Python script (standard library only, no API key, no install). <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Publisher: <br>
[keenable](https://clawhub.ai/keenable) <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
MIT <br>


## Use Case: <br>
Agents run the bundled script to perform natural-language web search — finding current, citable information beyond the model's training data, with optional site and date filters. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Search queries are sent to the Keenable public endpoint and may contain sensitive or personal context. <br>
Mitigation: Avoid sending secrets or unnecessary personal data in queries; review returned content before relying on it. <br>
Risk: The script executes locally and makes outbound HTTP requests to `api.keenable.ai`. <br>
Mitigation: The script is standard-library-only and self-contained; review it before use and verify the endpoint host. <br>
